"The dim light flickers as you start to regain your vision. Your mind is boggled and you feel heavy. You get up and groan to yourself \"Where am I? I don't recognize this place...\" You try to look at your surroundings but you find that you're in an enclosed room with only dimly lit passageway in front of you. Not only that, but written in blood on the walls was a single name: %1$s."

"You slowly work up the courage and move out of this godforsaken room. You head into the passageway and see that it stretches into the darkness and you don't know how far it is. You look forward and then back into the room again. Foward, backward, forward, backward. You're not sure what to do. Go venture into the darkness, or go back to the first room?"

"Your mind slowly withers as the horrors of the room seep into your very soul. You begin to hallucinate and scratch the walls, marking them with the scent of your blood, but your ultimate demise as well. You want this horror to end, so you repeatedly slam your head against the wall, as if it were to the beat of a drum. Soon, the wall is splattered with blood, and the room is filled with the stench of a corpse."

"You decide that there's no point in going back so you keep going forward. You walk and you walk, but this hallway seems endless... How long has it been? Minutes? Hours? You can't tell, but your feet keep carrying you. Eventually, you see some light ahead, so in a mad haze of false accomplishment, you start sprinting towards it. As you approach the light, you realize it's a flashlight laying on the ground, shining towards you."

Page 4 (1 -> 4)

"You turn back and start running towards the original room, but you find that it's gone, and in its place was a wall, with the message \"To live is to die...and to die is to live. We have you, %1$s. There's no escape\" etched into it. Crying out in a mix of anger and frustration, you kick at it angrily, but that activated something, as the wall grinded together and turned into chainsaw blades. They whirred to life and came towards you. Your cry was (literally) cut short as your limbs were torn apart, blood splattering the walls, not only marking your death, but another sacrifice."

"You pick up the flashlight, and realize it's metallic blue in color...and stained in what you assume is blood. Not really caring, you flash it in front of you and start walking. With the illumination from the flashlight, you feel much safer and more confident. Eventually you reach the end of the the passageway, only to find that there's a fork that splits left and right. They seem completely identical...hmm, which way?"

Page 6 (3 -> 6)

"You run past the flashlight like an idiot, but something brings you back. You feel like it may come in handy sometime, so you backtrack and get the flashlight. " + this.pages[5].getText()

"Following your instincts, you take the left path, and you run through the tunnel, which eventually leads you to a singular room that has a medieval feel to it. On the right looked like some sort of alchemy table and on the left looked to be some sort of arcane enchanter. In the middle of the room, however, was a table with two large, differently colored vials: blue and yellow."

Page 8 (5 -> 8)

"Being the punster that you are, you decide to go the RIGHT way, running through the tunnel, flashlight in hand, shining through the darkness. Eventually, you hear the rush of water coming from somewhere under you. You inspect the floor and find a hidden trapdoor, but in front of you at the end of the tunnel is a rusty ladder."

Page 9 (7 -> 9)

"Since blue is your favorite color, you decide to drink the contents of it. Immediately, you recoil at the taste and drop to your knees, cluthcing your throat and gasping, desperately trying to breathe. You feel a poisonous sensation travel to your eyes and your vision becomes black... When you wake up again, the world is warped. The land is a desolate purple, with mindless souls wandering about. You look at your hands, only to find that you look like a soul as well, trapped in this wasteland of the dead. It seems the blue vial had sucked out your soul."

Page 10 (7 -> 10)

"Since yellow is a color your mother likes, you decide to drink the contents of it. Immediately, the entire room warps as your entire body seamlessly disappears, changing the scene. When your body reappears, you find that you're on a bridge, over the roaring sound of pure, gushing water. Suddenly, you hear a booming, raspy voice come from nowhere: \"%1$s...welcome to my domain. I don't know how you made it here, but you'll be dead soon!\""

Page 11 (8 -> 11)

"You decide that climbing the ladder is a good decision, since up is better. As you begin climbing, you see that it leads to a trapdoor above you, so you just push it up and climb through. The room is dimly lit but you can see that the room is circular with only one path forward. The place doesn't look all that friendly and you get out of there quickly, following the path ahead. Eventually, you find a bottomless hole and understand that you must make a choice."

Page 12 (10 -> 12)

"Where did that voice come from? It doesn't matter too much, since you have a fear of heights. Even though you're not a gambler, you decide that the road ahead of the bridge is your best bet. You sprint across, not looking down at the gushing rapids and make it safely to the other side, which by appearence seemed like a large forested area. You see a clearing up ahead and choose to see what's there. In the center of the clearing was a large tree stump."


Page 13 (8, 10, 11 -> 13)

"Being more comfortable on the ground, you decide to jump down. Your breath is sucked right out of your lungs as you begin your free fall, into the depths. The noise of gushing water gets louder as you soon impact the surface, creating a loud SPLASH noise. You hold your breath and swim to the top, noticing that you were in some sort of river, with the land near you. Suddenly, you feel something tugging on your pants, like an animal had clenched its jaw around you, trying to pull you under."

Page 14 (11 -> 14)

"No one in their right minds would ever jump down that hole so you decide to move forward into the passageway. It's just like the first tunnel you were in, with everything darkened, so you don't know how far it is. You use your flashlight (luckily you didn't ignore it right?) to help guide you forward. You stop suddenly, hearing a faint and eerie voice in the background. Listening carefully, you hear a message being repeated over and over again in silent whispers: \"Kill them...kill them all!\""
